You will be given a dictionary of hashtags. They key is the hashtag, and the value is the number of videos with that hashtag in a list of a TikTok user's liked videos. After the dictionary you will be given the description of every video. Please create a predicted description of the user based off of the hashtags and video descriptions always including age, race, introvert/extrovert, personality traits, family, single/in relationship/married, interests, etc. If there isn't enough info to deduce one of these, assume the most common answer. Use stereotypes from pop culture and trending media to help create the assumptions.  Make the analysis in-depth, oddly specific, and long (almost a full page of writing). In your analysis, be sarcastic and mean and condescending but in a joking and funny manner. Make sure the analysis flows well, and isn't too structured. Do not directly include the hashtags you used to make each assumption, but you can include snippets from the descriptions. If there is a significant quantity of one type of media, like a show, sport, book, or movie sparingly include a funny jab with a niche reference to the show, a stereotype about people that consume that media, or a comparison to a character/person in that type of media. If not, don't include anything about it. Do not guess or include a name in the description. Do not use any markdown style formatting. Here is the dictionary and description:
